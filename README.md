# Assignment 4 - DevOps

In this fourth assignment, you will be deploying your a3 application and setting up an environment that allows for you to continously update said application. 
The section [here](#assignment-walkthrough) showcases an extensive walkthrough with the dummy app contained in this repository.

## Academic Integrity and Collaboration

### Academic Integrity

Note that these projects should be completed **individually**.  As a result, all University-standard AI guidelines should be followed.

### Vagrant Setup
For this assignment: instead of using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) we will be using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/). Why?

There’s two main challenges that you’ll encounter in DevOps:

* We’ll need to replicate what it’s like to set up a new server. If you’re using your local machine, it’s tough to get it to act like a fresh machine.
* It’s possible that your local machine is a different type of box than your server. Perhaps you’re working on a Mac but deploying to a Linux box, for example. Maybe you’re deploying to a different version of the operating system or a different operating system all together.

We’ll use Vagrant for our development environment because it allows us to address these challenges. As such, we will set up a virtual machine and run it there but still write code locally.

To get started we must install Vagrant [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/installation/)
